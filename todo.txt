TODO LIST: add anything you can think of 
1. (not that important yet) create a new modified ft_strstr that returns only the section of string that matches a tetri shape (could we use strnstr? idk either.)
2. list_pre_check->valid_pieces: change "if statment" to exit if one of the strings don't:
	a. match a shape (after we add the shapes to tetri-all.c)
	b. have exactly 4 #'s.
	c. doesn't return (ft_strlen(tetri) % 16 == 0)
3. fillit algorithm (lol)
